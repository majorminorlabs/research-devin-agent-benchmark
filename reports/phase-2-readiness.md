# Experiment 001 Phase 2 readiness

Validated on 2026-09-14 without starting Devin or spending external credits.

Experiment 001 is now frozen as five cases × two independent SWE-2 conditions:
M=`swe-2-medium` and X=`swe-2-max`. The balanced interleaved ten-run order is
stored in both experiment manifests.

## Built

- `scripts/export_case.py` creates an agent-only workspace from a validated
  Phase 1 run root.
- `scripts/devin_runner.py` builds the inspected local Devin CLI invocation,
  defaults to a no-call dry run, and requires `--execute --confirm-paid` for a
  real call.
- `scripts/evaluate_run.py` captures the agent patch, public tests, optional
  evaluator-side hidden tests, regression status, and non-content reference
  metrics after a session closes.
- `scripts/smoke_test.py` exercises export, audit, dry-run planning, hidden
  test isolation, patch capture, and evaluation with a disposable toy case.
- `manifests/experiment-001-config.json` freezes the case IDs,
  `swe-2-medium`, `swe-2-max`, Fusion exclusion, local/noninteractive mode,
  billing evidence, and zero substantive intervention policy.
- `scripts/validate_experiment.py` validates all ten run records, condition
  balance, prompt identity, fresh export identity, audits, model IDs, Fusion
  exclusion, and an empty results root.
- `scripts/analyze_results.py` prepares exploratory overall, paired,
  case-level, and efficiency summaries without significance claims.

## Isolation validation

The five sanitized exports for E001-C01 through E001-C05 each passed the
reference-aware leak audit. The audit checks fixed hashes, reference-patch
fragments absent from the buggy baseline, hidden-test names, ground-truth
filenames, control-repository tokens, symlink targets, and Git history. The
export branches contain only the buggy source tree, public regression tests,
and safe task/setup metadata.

The local case package is `case-source` with
branches `E001-C01` through `E001-C05`. Creation of the requested private
`MAJORminorStudio/devin-agent-benchmark-cases` repository was blocked by the
authenticated GitHub account's lack of organization repository-create
permission. No fallback public or personal repository was used.

## Readiness and remaining checkpoints

The smoke test passed with `devin_invoked: false`. The actual runner path is
ready but must stop for human confirmation of subscription/credit budget. The
CLI's model list labeled both selected SWE-2 models `[Free]`; the Devin account
reported Pro, but promotional duration/quota/billing terms were not independently
verified. The existing `--confirm-paid` safeguard remains mandatory.

The installed CLI operates directly on isolated local workspaces, so the
private GitHub case repository is not required for E001. It does not expose a
general cloud task/handoff, stable session URL, usage/cost/ACU report,
repository branch, or PR creation flag; those remain manual/provider
checkpoints. Before Experiment 001, resolve the private case-repository
permission if remote packaging is still desired, and decide how the
case-specific legacy Python environments will be provisioned and recorded.
